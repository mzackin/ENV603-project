# ENV603-project
Files and scripts for ENV603 final project
The data within this folder shows global Google Search data for several big food trends over the last couple years. The .R and .Rproj files are the scripts for the chart I made using that data.
While this chart isn't quite as polished as the one I made using this data in Tableau, it came out decently. The two pieces I was struggling to figure out were how to smooth out the lines so they aren't quite as up and down (in Tableau it's more the trends that are graphed so you don't see every small up and down in the search numbers) and how to show all the years (2016-2021) on the x axis. Overall, Tableau was easier to make charts in using this data, but I appreciated the exercise of trying to replicate it in R.
